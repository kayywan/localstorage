Creating a day Planner

The purpose of this assignment is to create a Day Planner and utilize a browser's inherent Local Storage as means of storing daily tasks for the day. Morever, a color coded system would alert the user of which time interval they were be on, allowing them to see what time slots are in the past, present, and future.  It was also necessary that the day planner would be able to adapt to varying screen sizes.  

JQuery was encouraged, though not mandated, however, due to lack of experience and comfort with JQuery, vanilla Javascript was still the preferred method of writing the logic in the .js file.
